# Change: Enhance Documentation Structure

## Why

The Workflow Engine is a powerful open-source project, but its documentation needs significant improvements to match the quality of top-tier open-source workflow tools. Currently, documentation is scattered, incomplete, and lacks the structure and depth that developers and users expect from a production-ready open-source project.

To become a leading workflow engine in the open-source community, we need:
- Comprehensive, well-organized documentation that guides users from getting started to advanced usage
- Clear API documentation with examples
- Rich code examples and tutorials
- Developer onboarding guides
- Better discoverability and navigation
- Professional documentation website structure

## What Changes

- **Documentation Architecture**: Reorganize documentation into clear, logical sections (Getting Started, Guides, API Reference, Examples, Contributing)
- **Getting Started Guide**: Create comprehensive getting started documentation for new users
- **API Documentation**: Enhance and expand API documentation with detailed examples, type definitions, and usage patterns
- **Code Examples**: Add extensive, working code examples covering common use cases
- **Developer Guides**: Improve developer documentation with clear tutorials and best practices
- **Documentation Website Structure**: Create a documentation site structure suitable for hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Docusaurus
- **User Guides**: Add user-focused guides for common workflows and patterns
- **Migration Guides**: Enhance migration documentation with step-by-step instructions
- **Troubleshooting**: Expand troubleshooting guide with more scenarios and solutions
- **Contributing Documentation**: Improve contributing guide with clearer instructions and examples

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `documentation` (new capability)
- **Affected code**:
  - `README.md` - Enhanced with better structure and links
  - `docs/` directory - Reorganized and expanded
  - `examples/` directory - Enhanced with more examples
  - New documentation structure files
- **User Impact**:
  - New users can onboard faster
  - Developers can find information more easily
  - Contributors have clearer guidance
  - Overall project adoption and community growth
